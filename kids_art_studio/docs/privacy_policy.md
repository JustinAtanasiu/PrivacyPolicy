**Last Updated:** December 12, 2025

## Introduction

Kids Art Studio ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of children and families. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("App").

Our App is designed with privacy as a core principle — **all image processing happens entirely on your device**, and we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

## Children's Privacy (COPPA & GDPR-K Compliance)

Kids Art Studio is designed for children ages 4-12. We comply with:
- **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** in the United States

### We Do NOT:
- Collect personal information from children
- Require account creation or registration
- Use behavioral advertising or tracking
- Share any data with third parties
- Include social features, chat, or communication tools
- Allow user-generated text input for AI generation

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Kids Art Studio is built on a "zero data collection" model. We do not collect:

- Names, email addresses, or contact information
- Location data
- Device identifiers for tracking purposes
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Photos or drawings (these remain on your device only)

- Any form of personal information

## On-Device Processing

All features of Kids Art Studio operate **entirely on your device**:

- Vision framework analysis happens locally on your device
- Generated artwork is stored only in your device's local storage
- No images are transmitted over the internet

### Gallery & Export
- Your gallery exists only on your device
- When you export to Photos, images are saved to your local photo library
- Sharing is handled by your device's native share functionality

## Third-Party Services

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only
All app data is stored locally on your device:
- Drawings and generated artwork
- App preferences (dark mode setting, etc.)
- Purchase status (verified through Apple's StoreKit)

### No Cloud Sync
- We do not offer cloud backup or sync features

## Parental Controls

### Safe Design
- No freeform text prompts — children can only select from curated, reviewed style presets

- No social features or external communication
- Large, kid-friendly interface designed for small hands

### Purchase Protection
- In-app purchases require Apple ID authentication
- Parents can use Screen Time and parental controls to restrict purchases
- We recommend enabling "Ask to Buy" for family accounts

## Data Retention

Since we do not collect data, there is no data retention policy for personal information.

Local data on your device:
- Remains until you delete it manually or uninstall the app
- Is not backed up to our servers (we have no servers)
- May be included in your device's iCloud backup if you have that enabled (governed by Apple's privacy policy)

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) do not apply to our services. However:

- You can delete any saved artwork directly within the app
- You can delete all app data by uninstalling the app
- You control what you export or share from the app

## Device Requirements

Kids Art Studio requires:
- iOS 18.1 or later
- A device with Apple Intelligence support (A17 Pro chip or M-series)
- Apple Intelligence must be enabled in device settings

These requirements ensure that all AI processing happens securely on-device using Apple's privacy-preserving technology.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Posting the new Privacy Policy within the app

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
