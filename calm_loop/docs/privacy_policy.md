## Overview

CalmLoop ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application CalmLoop (the "App") handles information when you use our service.

**The simple version: CalmLoop collects no personal data. Everything stays on your device.**

## Information We Don't Collect

The App stores the following information locally on your device only:

- **Sound Preferences:** Your last selected sound and volume settings
- **Sleep Timer Settings:** Your preferred timer duration and fade-out preferences
- **App Settings:** Night light preferences and any customizations you make

This information never leaves your device and is used solely to enhance your app experience by remembering your preferences.

## Audio Processing

CalmLoop includes high-quality audio files that are:
- **Pre-installed with the App:** All sounds are bundled within the app download
